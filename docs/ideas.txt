Shared Data Structures
========
	Entity
	{
		string name
		pos[,] int 
		string entityType
	}



Actions:
Every action takes some "time". The action takes effect immediately, then the character
cannot act for the given time.


Characters:
Characters spawn in a random part of the giant world.
Hence they're very difficult to get to each other (one user's chars working together)
You can create characters near you for resources, but they get more expensive as you buy more.
This forces players to get creative (not just spam drones) AND encourages user cooperation.
